The meaning of a version number such as x.xyz is as follows.
The first two digits "x.x" are the Digital Research version.
The "y" is the Lifeboat release number, with optional "z"
being a minor patch in same.  "DQ" means double/quad
and "SD" means single density.


The information below reflects various version changes.

(4/29/78) Version 1.40
---------------------

	This original CP/M on Altair from Lifeboat Associates
was the first available.


(7/22/81) Version 2.20
----------------------

	This is the first release of CP/M version 2
on Altair.


	Features in this CP/M over the 1.4 version include:
	--------------------------------------------------

1.	The CONFIG program now allows installation of a printer
	driver.

2.  	SETCPM program allows inspection and change
	of most system options.

3.	A single drive system may be used as a four drive
	logical system.  CP/M will prompt you to switch disks.

4.	Disk files are completely compatable with CP/M 1.4 files.


	The file USER.ASM on this disk is the same
as produced by CONFIG.COM using terminal 0.  This is
correct for an Altair 88-2SIO or Turnkey board.

	Please note that an extra jump in the USER AREA
jump table has been added.  This is for initialization on
warm boots and  has the effect of moving all JMP's in the
jump table down one,  except for the first (cold init).

	If you are using an old USER.ASM file which you
have modified, change it accordingly.  Also make sure the
equates in your file for BIOS and USER are the same as
the file on this disk.
